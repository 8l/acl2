[Jared] proposals of things to do:

 - Merge bstar and xdoc base into ACL2

 - Get rid of cltl1 support

 - Change ACL2 to support Unicode everywhere

 - Incorporate Quicklisp and use bordeaux-threads instead of our own
   parallelism primitives, or turn our threading primitives into a
   new Common Lisp library to compete with bordeaux-threads.

 - Move build-related stuff (e.g., make-tags, copy-distribution) out
   of acl2-init.lisp and into the Makefile, eliminate explicit lists
   of files in make-tags, etc.

 - Can we make the ACL2 build more parallel?  I'd like to separately
   compile new files like tag-tree and term-order, since they don't
   depend on one another.  Splitting out these dependencies would be
   informative for modularizing the system.

 - Consolidate lisp-related checking stuff

 - Localize variables to the extent possible

 - Why have *lisp-extension*?  We seem to have many uses of ".lisp" in
   the sources...

 - Change mergesorts to not use odd/even (worse performance than
   first-half/last-half)
